"For this example, we'll conduct a frequency analysis using historical "

"comprising hydrological information. Here, we use the `xdataset "

" library to acquire hydrological data from the `Minist√®re de "
"l'Environnement, de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques, de la "
"Faune et des Parcs <https://www.cehq.gouv.qc.ca/atlas-hydroclimatique"
"/stations-hydrometriques/index.htm>`__ in Quebec, Canada. Specifically, "
